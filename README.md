# dictionary_game

This project is a simple game I made myself as part of the requirements of one of my courses.  This is mainly made with the Flutter framework.

A dictionary game that lets the user guess unscrambled words from a Dictionary API. The user has the ability to select the difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) of the game before starting. The length of the words are based on the selected difficulty. He/she also has the power to choose how many words he/she will guess. 

A hint button is available whenever the user needs a help in guessing the current word. It displays its definition, synonyms, and what part of speech it is.
